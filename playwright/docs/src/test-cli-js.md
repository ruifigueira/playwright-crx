  ```

- Run a set of test files

  npx playwright test tests/todo-page/ tests/landing-page/
  ```

- Run files that have `my-spec` or `my-spec-2` in the file name
  ```bash
  npx playwright test my-spec my-spec-2
  ```

  ```

- Run tests in headed browsers
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --headed

- Run all the tests against a specific project
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --project=chromium
  ```

- Disable [parallelization](./test-parallel.md)

## Reference

Complete set of Playwright Test options is available in the [configuration file](./test-use-options.md). Following options can be passed to a command line and take priority over the configuration file:

| Option | Description |
| :- | :- |
| `--headed` | Run tests in headed browsers. Useful for debugging. |
|`--browser`| Run test in a specific browser. Available options are  `"chromium"`, `"firefox"`, `"webkit"` or `"all"` to run tests in all three browsers at the same time. |
| `--debug`| Run tests with Playwright Inspector. Shortcut for `PWDEBUG=1` environment variable and `--timeout=0 --max-failures=1 --headed --workers=1` options.|
| `-c <file>` or `--config <file>`| Configuration file. If not passed, defaults to `playwright.config.ts` or `playwright.config.js` in the current directory. |
| `-c <dir>` or `--config <dir>`| Configuration file. If not passed, defaults to `playwright.config.ts` or `playwright.config.js` in the current directory. |
| `--forbid-only` | Whether to disallow `test.only`. Useful on CI.|
| `-g <grep>` or `--grep <grep>` | Only run tests matching this regular expression. For example, this will run `'should add to cart'` when passed `-g "add to cart"`.  The regular expression will be tested against the string that consists of the test file name, `test.describe` name (if any) and the test name divided by spaces, e.g. `my-test.spec.ts my-suite my-test`. |
| `--grep-invert <grep>` | Only run tests **not** matching this regular expression. The opposite of `--grep`. |
| `--global-timeout <number>` | Total timeout for the whole test run in milliseconds. By default, there is no global timeout. Learn more about [various timeouts](./test-timeouts.md).|
| `--list` | list all the tests, but do not run them.|
| `--max-failures <N>` or `-x`| Stop after the first `N` test failures. Passing `-x` stops after the first failure.|
| `--output <dir>` | Directory for artifacts produced by tests, defaults to `test-results`. |
| `--pass-with-no-tests` | Allows the test suite to pass when no files are found. |
| `--project <name>` | Only run tests from one of the specified [projects](./test-projects.md). Defaults to running all projects defined in the configuration file.|
| `--quiet` | Whether to suppress stdout and stderr from the tests. |
| `--repeat-each <N>` | Run each test `N` times, defaults to one. |
| `--reporter <reporter>` | Choose a reporter: minimalist `dot`, concise `line` or detailed `list`. See [reporters](./test-reporters.md) for more information. |
| `--retries <number>` | The maximum number of [retries](./test-retries.md#retries) for flaky tests, defaults to zero (no retries). |
| `--shard <shard>` | [Shard](./test-parallel.md#shard-tests-between-multiple-machines) tests and execute only selected shard, specified in the form `current/all`, 1-based, for example `3/5`.|
| `--timeout <number>` | Maximum timeout in milliseconds for each test, defaults to 30 seconds. Learn more about [various timeouts](./test-timeouts.md).|
| `--trace <mode>` | Force tracing mode, can be `on`, `off`, `on-first-retry`, `on-all-retries`, `retain-on-failure` |
| `--ignore-snapshots` | Whether to ignore [snapshots](./test-snapshots.md). Use this when snapshot expectations are known to be different, e.g. running tests on Linux against Windows screenshots. |
| `--update-snapshots` or `-u` | Whether to update [snapshots](./test-snapshots.md) with actual results instead of comparing them. Use this when snapshot expectations have changed.|
| `--workers <number>` or `-j <number>`| The maximum number of concurrent worker processes that run in [parallel](./test-parallel.md). |
